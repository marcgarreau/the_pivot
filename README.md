[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/marcgarreau/the_pivot.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/marcgarreau/the_pivot)
#TO DO
##Week 1
* ~~~Translate everything into stories (16 - 24 stories)~~~
* Create listings
    Hosts may list multiple accommodations (i.e., multiple guest rooms, couch, etc.)
* Hosts can visit:
    own listing page
    other host's listing pages
    all listings in system
* Filtering on aggregate listings page

##Week 2
* add photos to new listing form
*


#Customer Expectations
* Listings are shown in tile format (4-6 across, 4 down)
* Filtering is handled on left side of main page, with white space on right side of listings


###Project Workflow
Work for the project should go through this process:

* A story is written in the project management tool in this manner:
    Identity
    Context
    Action
    Outcome
* A developer comments on the story that they’re beginning work
* They create a feature branch
* They develop and test the feature
* They push the feature branch to the repository
* They submit a pull request asking to merge the branch into master
* A teammate reviews the code for quality and functionality
* The teammate merges the pull request and closes the story/issue
* Later, the customer will review the delivered features by browsing closed pull requests


#Base Expectations
##Extend Dinner Dash so that it can handle multiple, simultaneous hosts.
##Each host has their own:
  name
  unique URL pattern
  items (listings [multiple])
  orders (reservations)
  administrators


* User Account
  Users register on the site and can be:
    both hosts (the business)
    and travelers (the customer)

##Hosts
* A host has a listings page where they list available accommodations and they have
  a profile with their photo, name, and description

##Listings
* A listing has:
    a title
    description
    categories
    quantity available
    people-per-unit
    daily rate
    photos
    location
    shared/private bathroom indicator
    available dates
* The hosts can either confirm or deny requests from Travelers

##Travelers
* A traveler can browse the site and view all available listings
* They can add one or more listings along with requested dates to their cart
* Their profile has their name, photo, and previous bookings
* When they checkout, the hosts are notified of the requests
* The traveler is notified when request status changes
* A traveler will need a good way to roll up all their bookings into an itinerary
  that helps them get from place to place with a map and pushes data to their Google Calendar.

#Submission Guidelines
- *Your project must be "live" on the web for your evaluation. We recommend you deploy it on Heroku*
- *Your README file on GitHub should contain a link to your live site*
- *On the production site, the URL path /code should redirect the user to the GitHub repository*
